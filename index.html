                The Maldives had always been my dream destination. I had read about the place in one of my school books and had been wanting to go there since. My dad had planned a trip to the Maldives in the month of July, and many of my friends and relatives were also going to join.

                Talking a little about me, I have travelled to a lot of places since I was a child and we generally travelled in huge groups. But from the past few years due to several reasons, I had been travelling only with my family. This time, for the Maldives after a really long time, many of my friends and cousins were going to join and I really really wanted to go, but I had my college events and classes scheduled and couldn’t afford to take a 5-day break. So, everyone’s tickets had been booked and I was trying to make peace with the fact that I was not going.
                <p class="quote">"An ocean breeze puts the mind at ease."</p>
                <p>Well, fortunately, 2 days before the trip was to begin, a chance opened up for me to go. There was a cancellation in the group and my dad asked if I would be able to come. I checked my class schedule which had been changed recently and saw that I would be able to accommodate a 5-day break quite easily without missing on many classes.

                So, there it was- it was decided, I was going to the Maldives!!! I was so excited. Furthermore, the trip was planned for just a day after my birthday, which made it a perfect birthday gift for me! After 10 long years, I was going to travel with my best friends and my cousins!

                As it was a last-minute decision, I decided that only my parents would know and I would give all the others a surprise by directly showing up at the airport. And that’s precisely what I did! Everyone was overjoyed and we couldn’t wait to get there.</p>

                <p>It was honestly the best vacation of my life. Believe me when I say the place didn’t disappoint us at all. We never realized how 5 days just went by, and none of us wanted to leave that place so soon.</p>
